# Patient-Triage-System

## Overview 
This is an implementation of a futuristic automated emergency room (ER) triage system which receives data in the form of patient and injury pairs over time and automatically
assign patients to doctors as the resources become available depending on the severity of the patient’s injury. This is implemented using a data structure called **priority queue** – more
specifically, a **heap-based priority queue**.
